"""Tuples

A script to explain all tuple related operations.

Tuple is a python data structure/collection which is an immutable sequence. It is quite similar
to the list but it's elements can not be changed

Tuples can be declared in following way

a_tuple = (1,2,3,4)

To declare a tuple, wrap elements (parentheses)

You can also declare an empty tuple as

a_tuple = ()

Parentheses are optional, however we should use it

Remember tuple supports mixed datatypes
